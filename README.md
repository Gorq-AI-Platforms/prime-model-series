<p align="center">
  <strong>Gorq PRIME</strong> is a coordinated model & research series from <a href="https://gorqai.digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorq AI Platforms</a>, designed to advance practical, accessible, and ethical AI. This repository documents the PRIME series: goals, research principles, collaboration pathways, and progress — rather than providing or redistributing model weights.

## About the PRIME series
Gorq PRIME is a planned series of models, tools and companion systems intended to accelerate responsible AI adoption for public benefit. The series will target:

- **General-purpose assistance & automation** — task planning, coding assistance, and workflow automation with safe defaults.  
- **Multilingual & local-first capabilities** — prioritizing language coverage for underserved regions.  
- **Research-first design** — combining applied research and engineering to produce reliable, auditable behaviors.  
- **Open collaboration and inclusion** — community contributions, third-party audits, and transparent model cards.

> The PRIME series is an ongoing initiative — work, experiments and releases will be published progressively under the Gorq umbrella. This repo collects documentation, design notes and contribution guidance for the series.

## Rebuild Initiative & Why PRIME
In 2025 Gorq committed to a Rebuild Initiative to recover from infrastructure setbacks and to reimagine the project with stronger, more resilient systems and community governance. PRIME is the strategic outcome of that initiative: a modular model series and platform architecture intended to be maintainable, auditable and accessible.

Key objectives of the Rebuild Initiative:
- Reconstruct model development and data pipelines with fault-tolerant storage and backup.  
- Improve reproducibility and traceability of training data and experiments.  
- Emphasize low-cost / donation-backed access tiers so research and tools remain accessible.  
- Build tooling for responsible release: documentation, model cards, bias testing and red-teamning.

---

## Research & System Design Principles
Gorq PRIME follows these guiding principles in research and engineering:

- **Safety first** — safety reviews, evaluation harnesses and mitigations integrated into every release cycle.  
- **Modularity** — models, adapters, instruction datasets and evaluation suites designed as interchangeable components.  
- **Transparency & reproducibility** — clear model cards, experiment logs, and reproducible training recipes where licensing permits.  
- **Localization & inclusivity** — prioritize datasets, evaluation, and interfaces for local languages and underserved communities.  
- **Resource-frugal engineering** — efficient training to lower entry-barriers.

---

## Repository scope & contents
This repository is the PRIME *series* home and SHOULD NOT contain raw model weights. Instead it contains:

- `docs/` — design documents, model cards and evaluation plans.  
- `research/` — whitepapers, reproducible experiment notebooks, and training recipes.  
- `tools/` — scripts for dataset processing, evaluation harnesses and CI checks.  
- `community/` — contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and governance notes.

---

## How we run experiments (high level)
The PRIME engineering workflow emphasizes reproducibility and low-cost experimentation:

1. **Data & curation** — curated datasets with clear provenance and metadata.  
2. **Adapter-first training** — auditable models trained with targeted instruction data to reduce cost and speed iteration.  
3. **Evaluation suites** — automated unit tests, functional tests (for code tasks), and safety/bias suites.  
4. **Staging & canary releases** — staged deployments with usage monitoring before wider availability.  
5. **Community review** — model cards, reproducible scripts and public issue trackers for feedback.

## Contributing
We welcome contributors who share the mission of accessible, ethical AI.

- Read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` in this repo (see `community/`) for the contribution workflow.  
- Fork the repo, open a feature branch and submit a PR.  
- For research contributions: include experiment metadata and a reproducible notebook.  
- For code: include tests and CI-friendly changes.  
- If you want to help with compute, ops, or audits, open an issue titled `Volunteer: <area>` so the team can respond.

## Privacy, licensing & model notes
- PRIME series artifacts will carry clear licensing & model cards. most releases may be closed-weight for safety, compliance or partner reasons — those decisions will be documented in the model card.  
- DO NOT assume artifacts in this repository are production-ready; treat all experimental code/data as subject to change.
